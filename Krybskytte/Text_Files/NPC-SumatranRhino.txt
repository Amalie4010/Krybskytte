Just because i am a rhino doesn't mean I have to be big, 
my family is the smallest of the living rhinos, 
and the only Asian rhino which has 2 horns. 
But it doesn't mean we have to be poached for those reasons. 
There are only around 40 of my family left. 
I know you want our horns for traditional medicine 
that hasn't been proven to work, but we don't want to go extinct either.
