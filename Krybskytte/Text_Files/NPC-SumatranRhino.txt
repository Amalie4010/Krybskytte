Just because I am a rhino, it doesn't mean I have to be big. 
My family is the smallest of the living rhinos, and the 
only Asian rhino which has 2 horns. But that doesn't mean 
we have to be poached! There are only around 40 of my family left. 
I know you want our horns for traditional medicine, but that 
hasn't been proven to work, and we don't want to go extinct either.
