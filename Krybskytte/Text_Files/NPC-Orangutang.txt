We the orangutan have different types of families, one 
being the Tapanuli, where we only have 800 left, we were 
supposed to be men of the forrest, but now our home is being 
ruined, when we try to find food or a new home, we are being 
poached. They take our skulls and sell them, and our kids 
are being stolen as pets.
