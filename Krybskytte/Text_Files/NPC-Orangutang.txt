We, the orangutan, have different types of families, 
one of them being the Tapanuli, but we are only 800 left, 
We were supposed to be men of the forrest, but now our home 
is being ruined. When we try to find food or a new home, we 
are being poached. They take our skulls and sell them, and 
our kids are being stolen as pets.
