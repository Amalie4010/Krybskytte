You’re a wolf. Together with your wolf brother, you have waited,
and the terrible storm has finally gone quiet. The sun is out.
You and your brother are separated from your parents,
though you were both told where to meet if you were ever separated.

While heading to the designated meeting place, you hear a shot: BOOM!
You’re hurt, though not fatally.
You wait while your brother goes to meet your parents at the designated place
and bring them back so you can together defeat the poacher.

The trip will take 10 days. Survive these 10 days while being hunted
by the Poacher…

Find and interact with NPCs to obtain items.
Use these items to evade the traps laid by the Poacher,
who hunts you during the night.
