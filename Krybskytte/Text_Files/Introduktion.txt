The terrible storm has finally gone quiet and the sun is out.
You and your brother are seperated from your parents, 
though you were both told where you should meet if you ever were seperated.
When going to the designated place, you hear a shot: BOOM! 
You're hurt, though not fatally. 
You wait, while your brother is going to meet them at the designated place,
and bring them back, so that you together can beat the poacher.
The trip takes 10 days. Survive 10 days while you're being hunted,
by the Poacher...
