The terrible storm has finally gone quiet and the sun is out.
You and your brother are seperated from your parents, 
though you were both  told where they should meet if they ever were seperated.
When going to designated place, you hear a shot, BOOM!, 
your hurt, though not fatally. 
You wait, while your brother is going to meet them at the designated place,
and bring them back so you together can beat the poacher.
The trip takes 10 days, survive 10 days while your being hunted,
By the Poacher...
