Our species have a very distinct shell, where the scales 
overlap, a lot of people seems to like since we keep getting 
poached for our special shells. They take our life for our 
beautiful shells, to make jewelry and ornaments. Even though 
it has been illegal for a long time, we are still poached 
and traded a lot.
