My species is one of the biggest turtles there are, we 
live mainly in the Eastern pacific ocean. We migrate long 
distances where we feed and lay eggs, but we don't even 
get to live, before we hatch our eggs are taken, and when 
we do get to live we face hunting everyday and we get 
caught in fishing nets when fishing for other animals.
