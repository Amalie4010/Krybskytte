My family the Sunda Tiger a type of Tiger, it's estimated 
that 80% of my family has died to poachers. They are after 
my bones, and currently there are no evidence that poaching 
of my family has declined significantly since the early 
1990â€™s on the islands. Other than us being poached, our 
territory is also being ruined.
