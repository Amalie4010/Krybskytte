My family, the Sunda Tiger, is a type of Tiger. It's estimated 
that 80% of my family has died to poachers. They are after 
my bones, and currently there is no evidence that poaching 
of my family has declined significantly since the early 
1990’s on the islands. Other than us being poached, our 
territory is also being ruined.
